          <p className="font-bold">
            At our Annaly, we utilize multi-strategy hedge fund models that
            allow for agility and flexibility. Unlike traditional investment
            funds, which may be confined to specific sectors or asset classes,
            hedge funds can deploy capital wherever market opportunities arise.
            This freedom, combined with our analytical rigor, enables us to
            capitalize on market inefficiencies, take advantage of arbitrage
            opportunities, and hedge against downside risks.

                We provide exposure to alternative assets and strategies, which

                One of the key advantages is the ability to protect capital
                during downturns. Through short selling, hedging, and options
                strategies, hedge funds can profit even in declining markets,
